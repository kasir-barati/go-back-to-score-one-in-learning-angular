# Bootstrap stuff

- [Flex utility](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/flex/)
  - Manage the layout, alignment, and sizing of grid columns, navigation, components, ...
  - Apply display utilities to create a flexbox container and transform direct children elements into flex items.
  - Flex containers and items are able to be modified further with additional flex properties.
- [Button component](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/buttons/)
  - Interesting part is that we do not have `btn-block` as we had in bootstrap 4. Instead of that we can use grid system
- [Gap utility](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/spacing/)
  - While using `.d-grid`, you can make use of gap utilities on the parent grid container.
  - Instead of using margin utilities to individual grid items use this on the parent.
  - Gap utilities are responsive by default.
