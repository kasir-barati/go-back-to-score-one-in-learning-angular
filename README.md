# What is Angular

-   A JS framework to Create reactive SPA
-   SPA is an application that page does not refresh constantly
    -   All the changes done by JS, JS change DOM
-   Angular versioning:
    -   AngularJS had some fundamental flaws
    -   Angular2+ is a completely new written framework
        -   From version 2 most of the versions has a very good backward compatibility
-   Angular CLI
    -   Angular projects are very elaborate
    -   Optimize our code
    -   Scaffold a pre-written boilerplate
    -   `pnpm add -g @angular/cli`
        -   [Learn more about awesome `pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/)
    -   `ng new app-name`
        -   `app-name` cannot have white space, or name it test
        -   Add `--no-strict` to make it a bit easier to start but I do not think it would be necessary
    -   `pnpm start`
        -   Or use `ng serve`
        -   Start your Angular app
-   App Module
    -   App Component
        -   template/html
            -   Directives
        -   css
        -   typescript
    -   `imports` should contains which part of the Angular you need.
-   Configure bootstrap for styling
    -   Use native bootstrap
        -   `pnpm add bootstrap`
        -   `ng add bootstrap`
        -   `angular.json`
            -   append to `architect -> build -> styles`
                -   `node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css`
    -   Use something re-written
        -   `ng add ngx-bootstrap`
    -   IDK which one is better
